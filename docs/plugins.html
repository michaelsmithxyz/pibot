<p>piBot is fully extensible with an event based plugin system. In fact, many core piBot functionality is implemented using the same priciples (internal plugins are called modules).</p>
<p>piBot plugins are written in Python, and access to the bot is provided with a simple API. Most of the work involved in writing a plugin will be in dealing with the event system.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The most basic piBot plugin looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>NAME = &quot;testplugin&quot;

class Plugin:
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    def init(self):
        pass

def init(bot):
    pl = Plugin(bot)
    return pl</code></pre>
<p>The plugin system loads your module, and calls the <code>init</code> function, which it expects to return the plugin (in this case an instance of <code>Plugin</code>). All plugin files must have the extension <code>.mod.py</code>. They will not be loaded otherwise. Likewise, the <code>NAME</code> attribute is required in all plugin modules.</p>
<p>After all other plugins are loaded, the <code>init</code> function of the plugin will be called. This is where events would be registered, among other things.</p>
<p>Saving this plugin and starting piBot should result in a message being logged indicating that the plugin <code>testplugin</code> has been loaded.</p>
